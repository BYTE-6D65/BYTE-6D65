I’m a student, still poking at the edges of things.
I tend to drift away from neat categories and toward whatever feels interesting that week.

If there’s a theme here, it’s probably **user-space systems**, **data playgrounds**, and tools that exist because I wanted to see what would happen.

---

## Observations

I treat GitHub less like a résumé and more like a sketchbook.

Some repos are experiments.
Some are scaffolding.
Some are “this seemed like a good idea at 2am”.

They’re all attempts to understand systems by touching them.

## The Workshop

| Tool                 | How it usually goes                |
| :------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| **Go**               | Trying to impose order on chaos    |
| **TypeScript / TSX** | Curiosity, mild regret, repeat     |
| **Shell**            | Where I learn what *not* to type   |
| **Markdown**         | Notes, thoughts, half-formed ideas |

---

## Biases (subject to change)

* prefer understanding over polish
* suspicious of shiny abstractions
* interested in constraints
* easily distracted by strange systems

---

No roadmap.
No guarantees.
Proceed with curiosity.
